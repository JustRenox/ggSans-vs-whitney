# Fonts

I can't really upload the fonts here because of licensing and stuff.<br>
*but....* What i can do is tell you how to get them.<br>

Besides the obvious thing of just using google you can also get the new gg sans font from Discord itself.<br>
Just open Discord, open the devtools, go to "Network", reload the page and filter for "Font".<br>
Or even more convenient use the links that I already got this way.
